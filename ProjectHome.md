Initially this was strictly about modeling Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with javascript.
However, since its inception the project grew into other related AI paradigms - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and some functional "syntactic sugar" that is very useful in programming these algorithms.

In the future, I'd like to merge this with another project I started working on - <a href='https://code.google.com/p/jscollections/'>jscollections</a>, in order to have a single fully integrated codebase.
